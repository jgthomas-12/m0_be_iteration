# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - I actually feel really confident. I flew through that section compared to the conditionals and even managed to figure out some cool stuff that wasn't specfied in the homework. I found the square roots accidentally and then went back and figured out how to square the same array. I had one little hiccup on the last problem but also managed to figure out that answer while I was in the middle of writing a question. I feel like I just climbed a 12a. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? 
    - I feel like I just jumped off of a building and superhero landed with one knee cracking stone and zero bodily damage. I had one moment of productive struggle at the last challenge question but I was aware there was some kind of issue because of the return values I was getting. Managed to figure it out while breaking it down in a question. I feel like Doc Brown after figuring out time travel. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - Nothing. `each` is my "B****". 
    
    - `each` is my "Buddy" was what I was looking for. I'm going to keep messing around with different possibilities and see what comes from messing around. Sometimes it's the best way to learn, that was how I figured out that dastardly little method `unshift`.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? 
    - Not many but definitely Google. Or books...but probably Google.
